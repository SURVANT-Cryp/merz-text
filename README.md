“Through his collages and assemblages, generally entitled or subtitled <i>Merz</i>, Schwitters aimed to achieve an artistic synthesis, a new aesthetic order using waste products, convinced — to quote his own words — that ‘one can even shout out through refuse.’ The artist had invented the word <i>Merz</i> by chance when he cut it out of the longer <i>Kommerz</i>, which had fascinated him for its sound. <i>Merz</i> was a blend of the Dadaist pursuit of irony and paradox through the transformation of objects and the Russian avant-gardes’ notion of art as construction. It also drew from Cubist collages, although unlike the objects the Cubists incorporated into their compositions, the materials Schwitters employed in his works were not representations of external reality but mere signs; they had no value in their own right, only as integral parts of a composition.”
